                <p class="review-content">I've been in many book clubs / servers on Discord but The Castle of Athena was most definitely the most welcoming, friendly, and most entertaining one i've ever been in. The staff is so lovely and kind and they make you feel very welcomed. Everything in the server is well-organized so it's not overwhelming, but at the same time offers so much. They have many events such as bqotd's (bookish question of the day), readathons, buddy reads, wpotw's (writing prompt of the week), and so much more. They also have a reward point system by completing challenges such as reading, studying, answering the daily bqotd, and by participating in other events. I found that it motivated me to read/study and interact more with the server! The vibes are immaculate and this server has everything you're looking for. <3</p>
